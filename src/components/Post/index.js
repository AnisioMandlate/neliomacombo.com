// In here, we'll list all components to be used in
// mdx files. Since we cannot import directly there,
// we'll have to gather and inject from an external component (here)
// and pass it through MDXRemote component (you'll find it in /blog/[slug].js)

/* i.e.
const Components = {
  Header, // from 'import Header from "Header"'
